/*

There are already a small set of primitive types available in JavaScript:
boolean, bigint, null, number, string, symbol, and undefined,
which you can use in an interface.

TypeScript extends this list with a few more, such as
any (allow anything),
unknown (ensure someone using this type declares what the type is),
never (itâ€™s not possible that this type could happen), and
void (a function which returns undefined or has no return value).

// JS: boolean, bigint, null, number, string, symbol, and undefined,

// TS: any, unknown, never, void
